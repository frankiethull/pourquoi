Title: Verified Self-Consistency for Language Model Reasoning
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: Implements verified self-consistency voting to add robust, 
    step-by-step reasoning to base language models that lack native reasoning 
    capabilities. Generates multiple independent reasoning traces, extracts 
    and normalizes answers for consensus voting, then uses a strong verification 
    model to ensure correctness before returning final answers. Optimized for 
    minimal API cost while maximizing reliability on mathematical, logical, 
    and analytical tasks.
