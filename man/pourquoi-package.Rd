\title{pourquoi: Verified Self-Consistency for Language Model Reasoning}
\description{
Implements verified self-consistency voting to add robust, step-by-step reasoning to base language models that lack native reasoning capabilities. Generates multiple independent reasoning traces, extracts and normalizes answers for consensus voting, then uses a strong verification model to ensure correctness before returning final answers. Optimized for minimal API cost while maximizing reliability on mathematical, logical, and analytical tasks.
